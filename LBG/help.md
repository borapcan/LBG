# Library of Brain Glycans (LBG) User Guide

The [Library of Brain Glycans (LBG)](https://lbg.human-glycome.org/) is a freely accessible database designed to assist researchers in exploring the composition, structure, and biological context of brain glycans. It integrates mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography data, allowing searches by species, brain region, and developmental stage.

The **Library of Brain Glycans (LBG)** is a curated and continuously updated repository designed to facilitate the exploration of glycan structures, compositions, and their biological contexts in the brain. The database is structured to integrate multiple layers of information, including species, developmental stages, brain regions, and analytical data, allowing researchers to navigate complex glycobiological relationships efficiently.

### Classification and Organization

LBG is classified based on **data objects, data types, and biological contexts**, ensuring a structured approach to glycan research.

- **Data Object**: LBG focuses on glycans derived from animal models, particularly rodent brains, with future expansions planned for additional species.  
- **Data Type**: The database encompasses molecular mass, chromatographic retention values, and glycan composition data, supporting both mass spectrometry-based identification and experimental validation.  
- **Biological Context**: Entries are tagged based on the brain region, species, and life stage to provide a detailed view of glycan distribution and function.  

### Database Structure and Components

LBG follows a **relational database model**, interconnecting glycan data with species, sublocations, and life stages. The core elements include:

- **Glycan Entries**: Each glycan is cataloged with its unique structure, composition, mass, and chromatographic properties.  
- **Species and Brain Regions**: Glycans are linked to specific species and sublocations within the brain, providing spatial distribution insights.  
- **Life Stages**: Data is categorized by developmental phases, allowing users to explore age-dependent glycan variations.  
- **Studies and Authors**: Each glycan entry is referenced with supporting literature, enabling users to trace its discovery and context.  
- **Diagnostic Fragments**: Structural motifs associated with glycans are cataloged with molecular mass, motif identification, and static structural representations to assist in glycomic profiling.  
- **Pathology (Planned)**: Future updates will integrate pathology-related data, classifying glycans by disease relevance and providing comparative data between healthy and pathological states.  

This implementation aligns with the growing interest in glycobiology's role in disease mechanisms and will enhance LBGâ€™s utility in translational research.

### Curation and Versioning

To ensure data accuracy and usability, LBG follows a structured **curation model**:

- **Regular Updates**: The database is actively maintained, with periodic updates incorporating new research findings and refined analytical data.  
- **Versioning Policy**: When major updates occur, past versions remain accessible, allowing researchers to reference the dataset as it was at the time of citation. This ensures reproducibility and consistency in scientific communication.  
- **Curation Standards**: Entries undergo manual verification by curators to maintain data integrity, with contributions from researchers encouraged to expand the knowledge base.  

LBG is committed to maintaining a dynamic yet stable resource for the glycobiology community, balancing **innovation** with **continuity** to support high-quality research.

## Searching the Library

### How to  perform the search?

1. **Homepage**: Upon accessing the site, you will see the homepage with a search interface.
2. **Search Input**: Enter your query into the search bar. You can search by the following parameters:
    - **Glycan ID**: Search by a unique identifier assigned to a glycan.
    - **Species**: Specify the organism of interest.
    - **Brain Region**: Indicate the specific brain region.
    - **Study**: Search for glycans based on associated studies.
    - **Last Author**: Find glycans based on the last author of a study.
    - **All Entries**: To view all entries, leave the search bar **empty** or type a **star (*)**.
3. **Executing the Search**: Press the "Enter" key or click the search icon to execute the search.

### Filtering Options

The LBG database provides extensive filtering capabilities to refine searches based on specific research needs. Users can filter glycans based on:

- **Species**: Select specific organisms such as rats or mice.
- **Sublocations**: Filter by different regions of the brain where the glycan was identified.
- **Stages of Life**: Narrow results to glycans found at specific developmental stages (e.g., neonate, adult).
- **Mass**: Define a range of molecular weights to find glycans with similar masses.
- **GU (Glycan Unit)**: Search based on glycan unit values, which relate to chromatographic retention.

### Results Table

The search results are displayed in a structured tabular format, providing detailed glycan-related data. Each row corresponds to a glycan entry, and the table includes the following columns:

- **Glycan ID**: A unique identifier for each glycan entry.
- **Mass**: The molecular weight of the glycan, measured in Daltons.
- **Sialic Derivatization**: Indicates whether the glycan has undergone a sialic acid modification.
- **GU Values**: Displays the minimum, mean, and maximum glycan unit (GU) values, used for chromatographic characterization.
- **Monosaccharide Composition**: Lists the molecular composition, specifying the number of sugar residues present.
- **Species**: Identifies the species in which the glycan was found (e.g., rat, mouse).
- **Studies**: References research studies that include the glycan.
- **Stages of Life**: Indicates the developmental stage (e.g., neonate, adult) at which the glycan was detected.
- **Sublocations**: Specifies the brain region where the glycan was identified.

Users can click on a glycan entry to access additional details, including study references and experimental methods used to identify the glycan.
