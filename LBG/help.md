# Library of Brain Glycans (LBG) User Guide

The [Library of Brain Glycans (LBG)](https://lbg.human-glycome.org/) is a freely accessible database designed to assist researchers in exploring the composition, structure, and biological context of brain glycans. It integrates mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography data, allowing searches by species, brain region, and developmental stage.

## Accessing the Database

To begin, navigate to the LBG database:

- **URL**: [https://lbg.human-glycome.org/](https://lbg.human-glycome.org/)

## Performing a Search

1. **Homepage**: Upon accessing the site, you'll be presented with the homepage, which features a search interface.
2. **Search Input**: Enter your query into the search bar. You can search by:
   - **Species**: Specify the organism of interest.
   - **Brain Region**: Indicate the specific brain region.
   - **Developmental Stage**: Select the developmental stage.
3. **Executing the Search**: After entering your criteria, press the "Enter" key or click on the search icon to execute the search.

## Viewing Search Results

- **Results Display**: The search results will be displayed in a list format, showing relevant glycans that match your criteria.
- **Detailed Information**: Click on a specific glycan entry to view detailed information, including:
  - **Composition**: The molecular composition of the glycan.
  - **Structure**: Visual representation of the glycan's structure.
  - **Biological Context**: Information about where and when the glycan is expressed.
